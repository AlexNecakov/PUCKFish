We had a working meeting on 10/12 discussing the PDRR report, Shark Tank, and worked on sensor selection and other engineering design questions for the actual project.


PDRRR is complete aside from citations, will be submitted soon.


Peter was chosen as next team lead for Shark Tank night, I will be completing my Team Leader Report promptly.


Next working meeting with Andy and Anthony scheduled for Monday night (10/18)





Worked with whole team on figuring out design constraints based on the ECE challenges in the design


Discussed waterproofing, sensor, controller, transmission, and power requirements


Delegated responsibilities for the ME and ECE team members to work on


Lead discussion on different battery options/requirements for charging or replaceable batteries


Cover required for recharge port, must be water proofed


Replaceable battery may introduce additional complexity in shell that will prevent total pressure protection


Will noted issue with IMU as the device will be tethered in an abnormal way to the trap line, preventing full water current sensing in many cases


Investigating existing technologies for underwater current sensing


Began sensor research with Ammar on solutions for remaining sensors


Most can be done with cheap out of box components, except dissolved oxygen


Existing solutions for sensing it are very expensive (> $160), looking at developing own sensor


Optical and electric solutions exist to measure dissolved O2


Electrical may be challenging due to changing conductivity of water with salinity levels


Optical is very expensive in price and power budget


Goal of finding preliminary sensor selection by Monday to have a power budget and first order size estimate for MEs
