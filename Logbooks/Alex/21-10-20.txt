Met with clients again on 10/18


Went through and made a spreadsheet of all of the sensors we want to use


Most are not too complicated


Needed to find a pressure sensor that was waterproofed and would work at depth


Current sensor may be a challenge


Puck is not free floating, so IMU may not work


Investigated load cell type options, would make mechanical engineering much more difficult


Acquired hardware to attempt an IMU test to see how good data could be


Clients will be providing metrics for desired accuracy/precision for each metric





Shark Tank prep


Worked on Shark Tank presentation, extensive rewriting and reformatting of PDR presentaiton


Created ECE systems diagram with Ammar in Lucidchart


Helped Peter prep as he is team lead 2





Shark Tank


Won Shark Tank, answered many ECE technical questions when asked by alumni
