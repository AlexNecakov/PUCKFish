Last night (9/27), we met with our clients, Andy and Anthony. Victoria took meeting minutes, I have written some q&as I asked during the meeting.


Focus on making better tech to have less incidental impact on whales. (No replicating/reading whale sound)


Shipboard interface is not our job


Want more data collection overall, severe lack of that


Tracking: temp, depth, ambient light, dissolved O2, current, salinity


Likely use time will be 2-3 days on a charge, want 10 max


Target polling rate: 1 min, but can be lower if power budget doesn't work out


Transmitting only when surfaced, radio is garbage underwater


Speed needs to be fast during surfaced time to transmit


1MB at 50kb/s from 50ft away


Unit lifetime should be 3-5 years


Operate at 1100 ft


Ships have Marine Batteries (waterproof lead acid), to charge unit/power base station


No existing SW to hook into, API we build can be very flexible


Target format is CSV for data


Header attached by shipboard interface (including GPS)


Need to detect when submerged/surfaced


Andy and Anthony will offer free boat rides
