● Current fishing equipment is incredibly outdated
● This project is similar but not identical to Andy and Anthony’s project
○ They will share the google drive
● Design will need to be restarted
● The whale aspect is a tacked on environmental concern, they are shutting down fisheries
over this issue
● Ropeless gear exists, you need to know where it is and be able to grab it, the buoy has a
line down to multiple traps
○ Entanglement also harms dolphins
● You will not be able to do lobster fishing without the marker line,
● Ropeless works with 2 way communication, enough to get you on top of the trap, and
enough to
○ Buoyancy bags, whole trap comes up
○ Burn wire that releases the trap
● We should being less to effect the whales such as deterring or killing the whales
○ Unfortunately, coastal areas are mating areas
● Sound carries significantly better underwater
○ Engines carry out and disturb ocean communities
● Radio dies in about 5 feet underwater
○ They used a buoy for LoRa
● We are not actually responsible for 95%
○ They want to start gathering data, semi real time
● 600 trap, 200 hauled a day
○ Trap soaks 2-3 days
○ We will only transmit when above
○ We do not have to be able to do ropeless
○ We just need to design the body
● Fisher men are semi price sensitive, $50 is about the aim
● Dissolved oxygen sensors will be very expensive
● No price range for the base station, this will be a raspberry pie
○ This does not need to be complex
● Andy was looking at a pressure housing that does a smaller range but we measure the
deformation of the housing
● Biggest problem will be vias or ports for the sensors
● Fill it with polyethene, this will keep water,
● Sea water may impact the life of the sensors but they don't think it will really impact it
● Two big challenges will be measuring pressure and dissolved oxygen (60-70%) of
the time
● Current acceleration and velocity and an accelerometer
● Dissolved oxygen indicates if there are lobsters there,
○ This is also tied to other variables, we can calculate many variables without
specific sensors for this,
○ CTD is a super sought after sensor
○ NOAA data sets are very sparse, specific locations and specific times
● Fishermen are just starting to generate data, super valuable and super protective
○ This tells them about floor hardness, 3d mapping, etc
● Current software is called TimeZero
○ They will be willing to drop $10,000 if it will give us a leg up
Questions
● They had mentioned marine battery is basically a car battery sprayed with anti corrosive
○ Most boats will have bus bars, 11-14 volts dc, not the cleanest signal, no signal
conditioner
○ Can’t plug into the raspberry pi
● What will the unit lifetime be?
○ Would like to see 5 years, minimum 3 years,
○ Hardest issue will be the pressure, mitigated by filling with polyethylene
○ Stick to delrin enclosures, 3/16 stainless steel, aluminum,
■ They picture delrin plastic or poured epoxy into the mold,
● Get the sensors done first, housing doesn’t matter as much, the faster to testing
in water
● Anthony is in PHO 340
● Write all your projects in Latex
● CC pisano on emails about being able to do stuff like
● Don't mess with FDM, use the FormLab printers
● Make a bigger enclosures
● Get a pelican case
